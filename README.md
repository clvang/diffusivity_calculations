# Diffusivity Calculations

These are the fortran and matlab scripts I use to calculate molecular diffusivities (using Tyn and Calus Method).

- To run cd into folder with required input data (e.g. "hephex_experiments" or "propgly_experiments") and type in the command line "../source/molecularDiff"

- The main code is "molecularDiff.Rev02.f90"

- The "liquidDensities.m" script, predicts droplet diameter percent increase due to heating.
