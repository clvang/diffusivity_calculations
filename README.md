# Diffusivity Calculations

These are the fortran and matlab scripts I use to calculate molecular diffusivities (using Tyn and Calus Method).

- To run type into command prompt
	./molecularDiff
- The main code is "molecularDiff.Rev02.f90"

- The "liquidDensities.m" script, predicts droplet diameter percent increase due to heating.
